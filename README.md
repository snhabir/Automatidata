# Automatidata - NYC Taxi Fare Prediction Project

## üìä Background on the Automatidata Scenario
Automatidata collaborates with clients to transform their unused and stored data into valuable solutions. These solutions include performance dashboards, customer-facing tools, strategic business insights, and more. Automatidata specializes in identifying business needs and using data to meet those needs effectively.

Automatidata is currently consulting for the **New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC)**. The NYC TLC is responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles. Automatidata has partnered with NYC TLC to develop a **regression model** that estimates taxi fares before the ride, based on the data collected by the TLC.

The dataset provided by NYC TLC originates from over **200,000 taxi and limousine licensees**, who complete approximately **one million trips per day**.

> **Note:** This project's dataset is designed for educational purposes and may not accurately represent real-world NYC taxi rider behavior.
